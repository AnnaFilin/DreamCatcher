    "title": "Dreamcatcher",
    "description": "Dreamcatcher is a space where dreams become conscious.\nDreaming is a special state of perception in which one can experience reality with clarity and intensity equal to waking life. In this state, it's possible to wake up — to realize you're dreaming and begin to act: explore, move, influence what's happening. Lucid dreams are not fantasy, but an achievable state that can be cultivated by training attention. The first step is simply to notice your dreams.\n\nDreamcatcher helps bring dreams back into the field of perception. By recording images, emotions, and recurring motifs, you begin to recognize them while dreaming — and that opens the door to lucidity. Regular dream journaling strengthens the skill of self-observation.\nAnd this skill doesn’t stay in the night: it naturally spills into daily life. We begin to notice how often we live on autopilot. The practice of awareness helps us step out of that pattern — to see more clearly, feel more deeply, and truly inhabit each moment.\n\nThe reality of lucid dreaming is supported by both spiritual traditions and modern science. Neuroscientists, cognitive researchers, and psychologists actively study it. In recent years, it’s even been documented that people can communicate with each other within dreams and exchange information in real time. Lucid dreaming is not mysticism — it’s a real expansion of perception.\n\nDreamcatcher's AI tracks recurring dream elements — symbols, emotions, themes, and rhythms. Even if you’re not yet lucid, these patterns become keys to understanding internal processes.\nThe AI offers personalized interpretations, inspired by analytical psychology — not as fixed meanings, but as invitations to explore.\nIt's a way to see how the inner world is reflected in images, and to start paying more attention to what happens within — by night and by day."
